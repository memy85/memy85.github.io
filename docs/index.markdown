Greetings! to all who visits my github page.
My github can be found [here](https://github.com/memy85). 
My name is Jang, Won Seok. You may call me Won. 
I am a Computer Science PhD student at Umass Lowell, studying under the guidance of Professor Hong Yu at [BioNLP lab](https://bio-nlp.github.io/).
Before I studied at UMass Lowell, I studied Nursing at Yonsei University, South Korea.
I got interested in AI and Data Science, so I studied Biomedical Systems Informatics at Yonsei University.
My overall goal is bridging the gaps between technology and healthcare.
