## What interests me
I enjoy doing research. Overall, I have a lot of questions and a lot of ideas popping in my head. 
Having background in nursing, (<nervous>I did have some experience in the field as a nurse too</nervous>) I do have more interest in making contribution in healthcare. 
But my interests are not confined to healthcare.
As for my studies, I am currently focusing on bridging the gaps between the technological advances in computer science and healthcare. 
My research are mostly on NLP, these days its mostly about LLMs and developing applications that would help physicians and patients out there. 
If you find my works interesting and want to collaborate, [email](WonSeok_Jang@uml.edu) me, please reach out!
