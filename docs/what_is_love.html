        <h2>Counting the Stars</h2>
        In the autumn night sky,  
        I count the stars one by one,  
        remembering those I have loved.  

        A star for my mother,  
        a star for my father,  
        and a star for my brother far away.  

        And a star for my friend,  
        who stays in my memories  
        like the gentle wind of childhood days.  

        As I gaze up at the heavens,  
        I place a star for my love,  
        and another for my endless dreams.  

        Tonight, the countless stars  
        whisper soft secrets to my soul,  
        filling the darkness with longing and hope.
